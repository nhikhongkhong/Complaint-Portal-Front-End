          <p>
            However, on occasion we receive negative feedback or people express dissatisfaction or displeasure with an experience by lodging a complaint.

          <br />
          <p>
            At Murdoch, we are committed to ensuring all complaints or grievances are handled effectively and efficiently via our <i><a href="https://goto.murdoch.edu.au/ComplaintsManagementPolicy">Complaints Management Policy</a></i>, with the feedback assisting us in continually improving our performance. If you are not happy with the final outcome, you can also take your complaint to an <a href="http://our.murdoch.edu.au/University-Secretarys-Office/Governance-Services/External-avenues/">external agency</a>.
